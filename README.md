# üåü Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Projects** repository! Here, I‚Äôve gathered a collection of projects that bring machine learning to life, tackling real-world problems across different domains. Each project is designed to stand on its own, offering a deep dive into a unique dataset or challenge.

## üîç Overview

This repository serves as the main hub for various machine learning projects and assignments I‚Äôve worked on. Each project showcases different aspects of machine learning, such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

The goal of this repository is to:

Explore diverse ML algorithms and techniques.
Apply machine learning to solve real-world problems.
Share knowledge and resources with the ML community.

## üèóÔ∏è Projects
Here are the projects included in this repository:

1. [**Amazon Review Helpfulness**](https://github.com/eshita1991/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Amazon-Review-Helpfulness-using-TFIDF) : 

2.  [**IoT Network Anomaly Detection**](https://github.com/eshita1991/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/IoT-Devices-Network-Anomaly-Detection): 

## üî© Assignments

1. [**Assignment-1**](https://github.com/eshita1991/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Assignments/Gupta_HW_1.ipynb):  Utilised data exploration tools to explain `housing.csv` dataset, visualized data for extracting insights into relationships between variables like median income and house value, and highlighted key patterns and trends in the housing data, such as geographical distributions and income-based housing value trends.

2. [**Assignment-2**](https://github.com/eshita1991/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Assignments/Gupta_HW2.ipynb): This notebook analyzes the performance of tree classification models on the IRIS dataset using various ensemble techniques. It explores how methods like bagging, boosting, and random forests affect classification accuracy.

3. [**Assignment-3**](https://github.com/eshita1991/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Assignments/Gupta_HW3KNN.ipynb): This notebook implements a custom K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier from scratch with tunable parameters (n_neighbors, weights) and compares its performance and complexity to sklearn's KNN classifier using the IRIS dataset. This NB also includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to better understand the dataset.

4. [**Assignment-4**](https://github.com/eshita1991/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Assignments/Gupta_NaiveBayes_HW4.ipynb): Fit Naive Bayes Algorithm for digit classification with the MNIST dataset. Explored multiple variants of the NB algorithm (BernoulliNB, MultinomialNB, and GaussianNB) and evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics, and confusion matrix, while experimenting with different thresholds for binarization.

5. [**Assignment-5**](https://github.com/eshita1991/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Assignments/Gupta_HW5_Ques6.ipynb): Implemented the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method to solve a simple linear regression problem. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method, which is a fundamental technique for estimating the coefficients of a linear regression model. The notebook uses the `student_scores.csv` dataset, which contains data on hours studied and corresponding scores achieved by students. This implementation highlights OLS's utility in modeling linear relationships and provides insights into how study hours influence student scores
