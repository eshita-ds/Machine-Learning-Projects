## üîç Overview

This repository serves as the main hub for various machine learning projects and assignments I‚Äôve worked on. Each project showcases different aspects of machine learning, such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

The goal of this repository is to:

Explore diverse ML algorithms and techniques.
Apply machine learning to solve real-world problems.
Share knowledge and resources with the ML community.

    <td>Reviews have become an essential part of the online shopping experience. Reviews serve as the means for customers to make well-informed decisions on the quality of the product and services offered after the purchasing of the product. Our research aims to smoothen the decision-making process by evaluating customer insights and understanding what they find most helpful about products based on reviews. In this study, we are attempting to classify the reviews as being helpful or not based on their content, metadata, sentiment, and relevance to the product.</td>

    <td>The Internet of Things (IoT) connects devices through sensors, software, and the internet, enabling real-time data exchange across industries. However, as the number of connected devices grows, IoT systems face significant security vulnerabilities. Machine learning (ML) offers a transformative solution for enhancing IoT security by detecting anomalies in real time. This project aims to develop predictive models powered by ML to anticipate future attack vectors, improving proactive security measures.</td>

## üî© Assignments

1. [**Assignment-1**](https://github.com/eshita1991/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Assignments/Gupta_HW_1.ipynb):  Utilised data exploration tools to explain `housing.csv` dataset, visualized data for extracting insights into relationships between variables like median income and house value, and highlighted key patterns and trends in the housing data, such as geographical distributions and income-based housing value trends.

2. [**Assignment-2**](https://github.com/eshita1991/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Assignments/Gupta_HW2.ipynb): This notebook analyzes the performance of tree classification models on the IRIS dataset using various ensemble techniques. It explores how methods like bagging, boosting, and random forests affect classification accuracy.

3. [**Assignment-3**](https://github.com/eshita1991/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Assignments/Gupta_HW3KNN.ipynb): This notebook implements a custom K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier from scratch with tunable parameters (n_neighbors, weights) and compares its performance and complexity to sklearn's KNN classifier using the IRIS dataset. This NB also includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to better understand the dataset.

4. [**Assignment-4**](https://github.com/eshita1991/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Assignments/Gupta_NaiveBayes_HW4.ipynb): Fit Naive Bayes Algorithm for digit classification with the MNIST dataset. Explored multiple variants of the NB algorithm (BernoulliNB, MultinomialNB, and GaussianNB) and evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics, and confusion matrix, while experimenting with different thresholds for binarization.

5. [**Assignment-5**](https://github.com/eshita1991/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Assignments/Gupta_HW5_Ques6.ipynb): Implemented the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method to solve a simple linear regression problem. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method, which is a fundamental technique for estimating the coefficients of a linear regression model. The notebook uses the `student_scores.csv` dataset, which contains data on hours studied and corresponding scores achieved by students. This implementation highlights OLS's utility in modeling linear relationships and provides insights into how study hours influence student scores
