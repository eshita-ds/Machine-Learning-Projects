## üîç Overview

This repository serves as the main hub for various machine learning projects and assignments I‚Äôve worked on. Each project showcases different aspects of machine learning, such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

The goal of this repository is to:

Explore diverse ML algorithms and techniques.
Apply machine learning to solve real-world problems.
Share knowledge and resources with the ML community.

## üèóÔ∏è Projects
Here are the projects included in this repository:

1. [**AI Insights Enhancing Amazon Review Helpfulness and Smarter Choices**](https://github.com/eshita1991/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Amazon-Review-Helpfulness-using-TFIDF): Online reviews play a huge role in shaping customer decisions, especially on platforms like Amazon. This project takes a step further by analyzing and predicting the helpfulness of reviews while categorizing them by product type. Using techniques like TF-IDF, Lemmatization, and Stopword Removal, we process raw review text to uncover valuable insights. With machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost, we achieved an impressive 93.75% accuracy in predicting helpfulness in the Cellphones category.
   
	The goal is simple yet impactful: help customers make smarter purchasing decisions and enable sellers to optimize their product listings using key 		insights. By enhancing review quality and relevance, we aim to create a more meaningful and informed shopping experience for everyone involved.

2.  [**IoT Network Anomaly Detection with Machine Learning**](https://github.com/eshita1991/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/IoT-Devices-Network-Anomaly-Detection): In today's world, where smart devices and IoT technologies are everywhere, keeping IoT networks secure is more important than ever. This project focuses on using machine learning to detect and classify unusual behaviors in IoT networks that could pose security risks. By analyzing data from the IoT Network Intrusion Dataset-Hk Security, we apply models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and XGBoost to identify anomalies in network traffic. The goal is to provide a robust, real-time solution to protect IoT networks, mitigate risks, and ensure reliable operations through real-time anomaly detection.

## üî© Assignments

1. [**Assignment-1**](https://github.com/eshita1991/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Assignments/Gupta_HW_1.ipynb):  Utilised data exploration tools to explain `housing.csv` dataset, visualized data for extracting insights into relationships between variables like median income and house value, and highlighted key patterns and trends in the housing data, such as geographical distributions and income-based housing value trends.

2. [**Assignment-2**](https://github.com/eshita1991/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Assignments/Gupta_HW2.ipynb): This notebook analyzes the performance of tree classification models on the IRIS dataset using various ensemble techniques. It explores how methods like bagging, boosting, and random forests affect classification accuracy.

3. [**Assignment-3**](https://github.com/eshita1991/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Assignments/Gupta_HW3KNN.ipynb): This notebook implements a custom K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier from scratch with tunable parameters (n_neighbors, weights) and compares its performance and complexity to sklearn's KNN classifier using the IRIS dataset. This NB also includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to better understand the dataset.

4. [**Assignment-4**](https://github.com/eshita1991/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Assignments/Gupta_NaiveBayes_HW4.ipynb): Fit Naive Bayes Algorithm for digit classification with the MNIST dataset. Explored multiple variants of the NB algorithm (BernoulliNB, MultinomialNB, and GaussianNB) and evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics, and confusion matrix, while experimenting with different thresholds for binarization.

5. [**Assignment-5**](https://github.com/eshita1991/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Assignments/Gupta_HW5_Ques6.ipynb): Implemented the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method to solve a simple linear regression problem. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method, which is a fundamental technique for estimating the coefficients of a linear regression model. The notebook uses the `student_scores.csv` dataset, which contains data on hours studied and corresponding scores achieved by students. This implementation highlights OLS's utility in modeling linear relationships and provides insights into how study hours influence student scores
